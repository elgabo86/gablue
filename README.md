# Gablue

Gablue is a custom immutable desktop distribution based on **Fedora Kinoite** (KDE Plasma), built with the [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) toolkit. Optimized for gaming, multimedia, and everyday use.

Images and the system are continuously updated, following the latest Fedora releases.

> **Note** : tools and scripts created for Gablue are currently French-only.

## Features

- **KDE Plasma** on Wayland — modern, smooth desktop
- **OGC kernel** (Open Gaming Collective) — optimized for gaming (from ublue-os/akmods)
- **Terra Mesa** — up-to-date graphics stack with 32-bit multilib
- **NVIDIA support** — closed and open-source drivers via akmods
- **Gwine** — seamless Wine runner: launch .exe and .wgp files directly with no prefix management, thanks to a single shared prefix built on Proton sources. Bundles ds2xbox to emulate an Xbox controller for Wine games (like Steam)
- **Game packages** — .wgp (Windows Game Pack) and .lgp (Linux Game Pack) self-contained squashfs game bundles: package a full compressed PC game into a single file you can create yourself, then run it directly with no installation required
- **Gamepad shortcuts** — native C daemon for system actions via controller
- **Plasma Bigscreen** (BETA) — couch/TV interface, switchable from the desktop session
- **Flatpak** and **brew** ready out of the box
- **Automatic weekly updates** — system and flatpaks staged in the background
- Optional **DX mode** with Docker, Libvirt, QEMU, and ROCm for AMD
